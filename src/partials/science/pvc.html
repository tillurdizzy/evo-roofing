 		<h2>PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride)</h2>
 	</div>
 	<p>Meets the requirements of ASTM D4434</p>
 	<p>Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) is a trusted membrane that has been providing decades of waterproofing protection in Europe and North America. PVC’s popularity stems from its dependable, heat-welded seams, high reflectivity, superior physical attributes and resistance to water, chemicals, grease, fire and punctures.</p>
 	<p>PVC roofing systems have a proven track record of service both in residential and commercial applications, lasting at least 20 years. Many PVC roofs in service today have been installed over 30 years ago. Because PVC roofing membranes are UV-protected and moisture resistant, they require virtually no maintenance throughout their long service life. This further contributes to the conservation of energy, resources, and materials that are typically expanded to repair other types of low-slope roofing systems.</p>
 	<p>When it comes to recycling, PVC roofing membranes are superior to the other single – ply roofing systems, because PVC is the only 100% recyclable material in the flat roofing market. In fact, the majority of PVC roofs are recycled, and go right back into the manufacturing of new membranes, as part of the bottom ply. Moreover, installing a PVC roof can help you avoid sending your old roof to the landfill. A PVC roof is so light weight that in most cases it can be installed right over the old roof, eliminating the need to dispose of it.</p>
