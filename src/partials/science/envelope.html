 	<h2>The Building Envelope</h2>

	<p>The building envelope, or shell, is the part of a house that you can draw a line around: the roof, the walls, and the floor. All have to accomplish the same things: stop air, slow the movement of heat, shed water, and dry out so that the building won't support mold growth and rot. They all see the same elements — wind, water, sun, hail — but in different proportions.</p>
	
	<p>The materials and techniques used in building have to keep water from getting in as well as promote drying of surfaces that do get wet. This begins at the roof and includes all parts of the enclosure. Most moisture problems in walls and roofs are caused by moisture transported by air. Moisture can accumulate in a wall or ceiling when warm, humid interior air leaks through cracks in the shell. When this exfiltrating air encounters a cold surface—for example, OSB wall sheathing—the moisture in the air can condense into liquid and puddle in the wall cavity. The same thing can happen in summer, when warm, humid outdoor air leaks through cracks in the wall. If the home is air-conditioned, the moisture in this infiltrating air can condense when it reaches any cool surface—drywall, ductwork, etc. The best way to limit this type of moisture migration is to install an effective air barrier. If air isn’t leaking through cracks in a home’s walls and ceilings, the problem is nipped in the bud.</p>

	

 	<!-- <p>In high humidity environments, the migration of water from outside to inside is why we want our buildings to retain a 72 degree temperature.  This is the temperature that water falls out of the air. The closer you get to 72 the more comfortable you feel, unless you’re treating the building humidity separately from the temperature.</p> -->
 	<p>Prior to the new energy standards, a tar and gravel roof could hit 180 degrees, putting a massive heat load on the HVAC system. Now that maintaining temperature is easier with cool roofing systems, the HVAC systems no longer need to run continually to maintain a comfortable interior temperature, however, you may still be wasting energy and overloading the HVAC unless you address humidity, which should be maintained at the ASHRE standard of 40%-60% maximum humidity. The best balance is at 45-50%.</p>
 	<p>Small buildings can use dehumidifiers that can be installed into existing duct lines, and larger buildings can take one of multiple HVAC units (generally the smallest one) and convert to a dehumidifying unit.</p>
 	<p>In the same way that high-pressure air always moves to low-pressure areas, air with high moisture always moves to dry areas. Because of this, the location of the dehumidification unit in the building doesn’t really make much difference as long as the all of the buildings air is circulated.  Trying to get your HVAC contractor to understand this is often problematic, as they’re still taught old school of 500 feet of floor space equals 1 ton of HVAC. However, when the energy efficient building can’t get build heat, the HVAC system starts and stops before it can adequately remove enough water. All building now require separate units, one for water, and one for temperature.  Any other option is a waste of your money.</p>
