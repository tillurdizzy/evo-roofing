     <h2>Overview - Introduction to Single Ply Membrane Systems</h2>
 </div>
 	
    <p class="subheading">At Evolution Roofing Systems, our focus is on long-lasting, durable roofing systems.  This philosophy runs counter to the prevailing industry mindset, which is to guarantee future income by replacing your roof every 10-15 years. Thermoplastic polyolefin (TPO) is the fastest-growing segment of the commercial roofing industry, and is also the cheapest, least durable, shortest lasting roofing membrane.</p>
    <p>Sadly, most real estate developers intend to flip properties well within the lifespan of the roof, and are therefore simply not interested in the additional expense of a high quality lifetime roofing system.</p>
    <p>However, in many cases, that can be a very short-sighted view.  In negotiating a sale price for a property, more and more buyers are insisting on roofing inspections and discounts based on roof replacement timeframe.  Developers who intend to floip properties in a short timeframe can more than make up for the additional expense of installing a lifetime roof on the backend.</p>
 	
	<p class="subheading">There are 3 most-used single ply membrane systems present on the market today: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>EPDM</li>
        <li>TPO</li>
        <li>PVC</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="hrule"></div>
    <span class="subheading">EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer)</span>
    <img-with-caption class="right" imgsrc="partials/science/img/EPDM.jpg" cap="Typical EPMD installation." title="Fig 1"></img-with-caption>
    <p>A rubber-like black membrane, usually non-reinforced. Most common application method is a fully adhered (glued down) with glued seams / flashings.</p>
    <p> EPDM is the least expensive single ply roofing type and requires no special equipment to install it (unlike PVC and TPO which require hot-air welding equipment) and thus is the first choice for contractors entering the flat roofing market and asphalt shingle roofers.</p>
    <p>EPDM roof system life expectancy is 10 to 15 years. Although the material <a ui-sref="science.warranty">warranty</a> goes up to 40 years for a 90-mil EPDM from some manufacturers, it does not cover the seams. Failing seams are the main cause of EPDM roof leaks, followed by ponding water, for which EPDM has no warranty either.</p>

	<span class="subheading">TPO (Thermoplastic Polyolefin)</span>
    <img-with-caption class="right" imgsrc="partials/science/img/tpo.jpg" cap="Raw materials for manufacturing TPO." title="Fig 1"></img-with-caption>
 	<p>A roofing system composed of recycled bottles, tires and wax-based polymers.  No doubt you've heard the sales pitch touting the "new formulation" - in efforts to find the right balance between flammability and UV stabilization, the ASTM has allowed changes to the formulation 6 times since 2003! </p>
    <p>TPO roof systems are under continuous development by numerous manufacturers, who constantly change the TPO formulation to achieve the lowest cost with acceptable performance. A TPO roof from the same manufacturer will most likely NOT be the same as the one produced a few years before or after. Also, the quality of different batches of TPO membranes may be questionable, as some TPO producers release the product to the end user without getting the UL and similar approvals/certification, as the formulation changes too often.</p>
    <p>Life expectancy of a TPO roof is 10-12 years due primarily to plasticizer migration.</p>

    <div class="hrule"></div>
    <span class="subheading">PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride)</span>
    <p>A thermoplastic membrane, utilizing a reinforcement scrim between the two plies of equal thickness (IB roof only). Top ply contains Cool Roof pigments, UV stabilizers, and other components to extend the life of the membrane. Bottom ply contains PVC ingredients to provide consistent weld of top and bottom plies and fillers.</p>

     <span class="subheading">Elvaloy</span>
	 <img-with-caption class="right" imgsrc="partials/science/img/elvaloy-materials.jpg" cap="Raw materials for Elvaloy KEE." title="Fig 3"></img-with-caption>
     <p>DuPont™ Elvaloy<sup>®</sup> KEE is a unique ketone ethylene ester (KEE) terpolymer supplied in pellet form to makers of durable low-slope PVC roofing membranes.</p>
<p>When soft, high-molecular-weight Elvaloy<sup>®</sup> KEE is mixed with a more rigid material such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), the resulting compound becomes tougher and more flexible.</p>
<p>The elastomeric properties of Elvaloy<sup>®</sup> KEE are accompanied by convenient melting properties for thermoplastic processing. This makes the compound ideal for coating onto woven fabrics or scrim materials which are embedded in high-quality PVC roofing membranes to help fight against cutting, punctures or shrinkage. The thermoplastic characteristic of the compound makes heat-welding easier during installation and repair.</p>
<p>As a solid-phase flexibilizer, Elvaloy® KEE won't migrate out of the PVC roofing system, even when exposed to chemical pollutants such as grease or fuels. Chemicals such as these tend to extract many other plasticizers, causing membranes to lose flexibility and become brittle. The permanent flexibility and chemical resistance of roofing membranes made with Elvaloy<sup>®</sup> KEE makes them a proven performance leader in single-ply PVC roofing.</p>
<p>PVC roofing membranes made with DuPont™ Elvaloy<sup>®</sup> KEE are among the most durable, fastest to install, and easiest to maintain in the industry. Roofers experienced with thermoplastic membranes enjoy the reliable heat-welded seams and carefree performance of a strong, high-quality roofing product. Building owners who want their PVC roofing to last as long as possible, or who need extra resistance to weather and chemical attack, can specify PVC roofing made with DuPont™ Elvaloy<sup>®</sup> KEE terpolymer to assure decades of problem-free service.</p>
