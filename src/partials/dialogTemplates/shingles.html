 	<h3>Composition Shingles</h3>
 	<p>90% of all shingles come in two design types, a 3 tab and a dimensional or multi-layer shingle. The balance of shingle types, are designer or premium shingle lines with very specific patterns, made to represent a special look. Since all of the shingles are made from the same materials, lifespans are identical throughout the product lines, regardless of presented warranty by manufacturer. (See Warrantees below for more information).</p>
 	<p>All asphalt based shingles regardless of manufacturer are made from the same materials. asphalt, fiberglass felts and ceramic granules. Heat and water are the two leading factors in determining shingle life, not composition of materials. The general rule of thumb is, the greater the roof pitch, the longer the roof will last. This is a science based reality, in that the building will gain heat from the sun, forcing the vital oils in the shingle to float to the shingle surface. When the rain comes, it washes these oils away leaving the carbon behind. As the oil dissipates the shingles loose flexibility and mass. As the adhesion of the ceramic granules from the surface are demised from the loss of these vial oils, the granules will start to fall off exposing the black asphalt to UV radiation. This in turn excels the degradation and accelerating the decay of the shingle. On average we see shingle roofing systems last between 15 & 20 years in the Texas Gulf Coast and 20 to 25 years in our Ohio markets. Heat is the driving force, roof pitch is secondary to their failures. The faster rain water can run off, the less of the oils are washed away.</p>
