	<h3>Elvaloy</h3>
		<p>DuPont™ Elvaloy<sup>®</sup> KEE is a unique ketone ethylene ester (KEE) terpolymer supplied in pellet form to makers of durable low-slope PVC roofing membranes.</p>
<p>When soft, high-molecular-weight Elvaloy<sup>®</sup> KEE is mixed with a more rigid material such as polyvinyl chloride (PVC), the resulting compound becomes tougher and more flexible.</p>
<p>The elastomeric properties of Elvaloy<sup>®</sup> KEE are accompanied by convenient melting properties for thermoplastic processing. This makes the compound ideal for coating onto woven fabrics or scrim materials which are embedded in high-quality PVC roofing membranes to help fight against cutting, punctures or shrinkage. The thermoplastic characteristic of the compound makes heat-welding easier during installation and repair.</p>
<p>As a solid-phase flexibilizer, Elvaloy® KEE won't migrate out of the PVC roofing system, even when exposed to chemical pollutants such as grease or fuels. Chemicals such as these tend to extract many other plasticizers, causing membranes to lose flexibility and become brittle. The permanent flexibility and chemical resistance of roofing membranes made with Elvaloy<sup>®</sup> KEE makes them a proven performance leader in single-ply PVC roofing.</p>
<p>PVC roofing membranes made with DuPont™ Elvaloy<sup>®</sup> KEE are among the most durable, fastest to install, and easiest to maintain in the industry. Roofers experienced with thermoplastic membranes enjoy the reliable heat-welded seams and carefree performance of a strong, high-quality roofing product. Building owners who want their PVC roofing to last as long as possible, or who need extra resistance to weather and chemical attack, can specify PVC roofing made with DuPont™ Elvaloy<sup>®</sup> KEE terpolymer to assure decades of problem-free service.</p>
