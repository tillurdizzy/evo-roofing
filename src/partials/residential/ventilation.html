 	<h2>Ventilation</h2>
 </div>

   <p>A properly designed roofing system must contain a properly designed ventilation system. This is comprised of soffit ventilation and roof top ventilation. FHA (Federal Housing Administration) requires roof ventilation of 300:1 or 300 square foot of attic space to 1 square foot of free vent area, of which should be split 40% at soffits and 60% at ridge. Increases in this are recommended as the FHA recommendations are a minimum standard, not a perfect solution. We recommend a 150:1 ratio for southern climates. Again its science that drives the convection of air movement as an improperly balanced attic will result in less roof life expectancy.</p>
                <p>If your house has the original roofing system from the builder, remember the home builders use the cheapest source for building the home, with the contractor willing to do the job for the least amount of profit, winning the installation contracts. With this being said, we generally see that the soffit vents are nailed in place, but without the holes cut to allow the air in. By sliding an ice pick into the covered soffit vents, one can test to see if you have cut openings in your soffit.</p>
                <p>Over the last 30 years, we have noticed that buildings with poorly designed ventilation systems are more likely to blow off in a hurricane as the sealant strips are non-existent or the loss of vital oils in the sealing tabs and on Hail damaged areas, poorly ventilated roofs are completely destroyed as the house next door shows no signs of damage that was over ventilated.</p>
                <p>While one may enjoy the destruction of a roof getting the insurance companies to buy you a new one, Insurance companies are getting wiser to the roof replacement program when building owners use insurance as a replacement program. Most new polices have a 3-5% deductible for wind or hail damage, wont insure any roof over 10 years in age and will hire experts to determine if improper applications were used during its installation to put the loos onto the installing contractors or builders. Ventilation deficiencies and improper nailing procedures are prevalent in 95% of all shingle applications. If an insurance company can prove these deficiencies, you’ll pay 100% of the roof replacement, get your insurance canceled and then have zero coverage until it’s resolved. This also brings your mortgage bank into the conversation of cancelled insurance coverage.</p>
                <h1>Ventilation Types</h1>
                <p><span class="boldFont">Ridge Vent, Gable Vents, Turbine Vents of Static Design</span> – This will include wind turbines, ridge vent, air hawks & gable vents. All of these require the roof to get hot before convection of hot air rising to get the air flowing. We generally see the attic temperature getting to around 140 degrees and maintaining that heat load throughout the day, regardless of free vent area used.</p>
                <p><span class="boldFont">Powered Vents</span> – These come in two types, solar and grid tied. The concept of these are that they will maintain the attic in a few degrees variance of outside air temperatures, greatly reducing the buildings core heat gain through attic insulation. If your attic is 140 degrees, and the interior temperature desired is 72, you have a heat displacement of 68 degrees. The HVAC system is now running to keep your attic temperature’s down vs conditioning the interior temperatures. By keeping the attic a few degrees above the outside ambient temperature, on a 90 degree day, a 100 degree attic temperature is an acceptable condition.</p>
                <p>On average a grid tied powered fan has a ¼ HP electric motor that uses 186 watts per hour of operation. Or at $0.10 a kilowatt, in 10 hours of operation per day, it costs about $0.18 per day, per fan unit. Running (2) units for 1 year, cost to the building owner is $134.10. However a solar powered fan, cost upfront almost five times greater than a hard wired, yet in four years, pays for itself as no electrical costs are required.</p>
                <p>Another consideration is that high end solar fans use motors that have a 25 year warranty, verses a hard wired fans motors that only last 5 years.</p>
