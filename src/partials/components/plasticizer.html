 	<h3>Plasticizer Migration</h3>
 	<p>Plasticizers are chemicals added to plastics, vinyl, and rubber to make them softer and more flexible. The softer or more flexible the material, the more plasticizer it contains. Over time, the plasticizers migrate out of the rubber and are absorbed into surrounding materials. Heat and pressure can speed the process.</p>
