    <h3>Shingle Materials Design</h3>
    <p>90% of all shingles come in two design types: 1) Three-Tab Strip Shingle, or 2) Multi-layered or Dimentional Shingle. The balance of shingle types are designer or premium shingle lines with very specific patterns, made to represent a special look. Since all shingles are made from the same basic materials, lifespans are identical throughout the product lines, regardless of manufacturer warranty claims. (See Warrantees below for more information).</p>

    <p>All asphalt-based shingles, regardless of manufacturer, are made from the same materials; asphalt, fiberglass felts and ceramic granules. Heat and water are the two leading factors in determining shingle life, not composition of materials. The general rule of thumb is the greater the roof pitch, the longer the roof will last. This is a science based reality, in that the building will gain heat from the sun, forcing the vital oils in the shingle to float to the shingle surface. Rain then washes these oils away, leaving the carbon behind. As the oil dissipates, the shingles loose flexibility and mass. As the adhesion of the ceramic granules from the surface are demised from the loss of these vital oils, the granules will start to fall off exposing the black asphalt to UV radiation. This in turn eccelerates the degradation and decay of the shingle.</p><p>On average we see shingle roofing systems last between 15 and 20 years in the Texas Gulf Coast and 20 to 25 years in our Ohio markets. Heat is the driving force - roof pitch is secondary to their failures. The faster rain water can run off, the less of the oils are washed away.</p>
    <p><span class="boldFont">The greatest single enhancement a building owner can do to get more lifespan from a shingle system is to reduce roof top tempratures. Ensure the building has proper ventilation that meets or exceeds the minimum FHA standards.</span></p>
    <h3>Shingle Warranties</h3>
    <p>Its hardly a news flash to claim that warranties can be deceptive, and the shingle industry is no exception.  A warranty is almost always described as “Limited”, meaning the warrantable aspects require the building owner to maintain or meet a set of standards that are generally not achievable and the warranty is voided.
    <p>In cases where the warranty does cover a problem, the manufacturer often has the sole determination at resolving the problem, which may be simply replacement shingles or a certificate for new materials when you re-roof (as long as you choose to use their shingle system again).</p>
    <p><span class="boldFont">Even more importantly, the warranty does not cover the installation.</span>. The warranty is only for shingles, not the contractor’s application methods, ventilation or geographical location of installation.</p>
    <p> Generally, the warranty protects the manufacturer more than the consumer and should be disregarded when choosing a shingle system. Choose a shingle based on color, design and application. For greater life span and return on investment, choose a contractor that understands the system, the design and can install it properly.</p>
