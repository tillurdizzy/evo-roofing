        <h2>Underlayments</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Underlayments are used to temporarily protect the plywood roof deck from overnight condensation or rain until the new roof is installed. The underlayment is essentially destroyed by thousands of roofing nails once the roof is installed, however certain materials may offer additional enhancements to the completed roofing system as specified below.</p>
    <h1>Variations</h1>
    <p><span class="boldFont">Organic Felt</span> – Comprised of asphalt impregnated paper. Designed to withstand a few days in the exposed sun. #30 felt was used as a overlay material to smooth out the application of composition shingles over a wood cedar shingle. #15 felt is used in most re-roofing applications in today’s market. The only purpose of the felt is a temporary covering until the new shingles are installed. These products will absorb humidity and can cause wrinkling in the final appearance of the completed roof.</p>
    <p><span class="boldFont">Synthetic Felt</span> – Comprised of a polyester mat with a modified asphalt. These products are moisture resistant, mostly used in northern climates during new construction when the building hasn’t been completed, awaiting a shingle installation and a date down the road. These membranes can last up 6 moths in the exposed elements without degradation. In hurricane prone areas, the application of these underlays can help protect the structure if installed with button capped nails to help hold the underlayments in place in the event the shingles are torn from the structure in high winds.</p>
    <p><span class="boldFont">Self-Adhering</span> - These materials are actually a version of modified bitumen flat roofing systems with no granular or UV protection. Mostly used in low slope applications or roof pitched with a roof slope of 3:12 roof pitch or less. The concept is a nail penetrating the roof deck will be sealed within this membrane preventing the water from intruding the structure. However, when used in these applications, you must also use stainless steel nails as a low pitch roof will always let water migrate between the shingle overlaps and sit in the areas between the shingles and the underlayment until the suns heat evaporates the water. In beach from applications, the salt spray will build up a layer of salt under the shingles compromising the nail heads within a few years rendering the underlayment irrelevant. For high wind or hurricane areas, the membrane cannot be blown off of the plywood, even if you lose the entire shingle roof, making building damage very minimal. </p>
