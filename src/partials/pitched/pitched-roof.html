    <h3>Composition Shingles</h3>
    <p>These products are comprised of fiberglass felts, asphalt and ceramic granules. While 90% of the marketed products contain the same compounds, only the granule surface and cut design differentiates the manufacturers. In southern markets, lifespan of the materials is around 15-17 years depending on ventilation and roof slope. Northern clients above Texas Oklahoma boarder line, could see roof life expectancies of 25-30 years. Since the shingles all come from the same manufacturing line, a 20-Year three tab shingle, will last the same amount of time as a lifetime dimensional shingle. Customers confuse wording by manufacturers for warranties as the new catchphrase of “Lifetime” is about the products theoretical time of life to expect, vs lasting a lifetime. Its word play to protect the manufacturers, not the building owner. Our recommendation is to buy what looks the best, warranties hold no inherent value to building owners, by design. Finding a contractor that understands proper ventilation and application techniques are key to longevity. Return on investment is mediocre at best, but value for the dollar is average.</p>
    <p><span class="boldFont">The greatest single enhancement a building owner can do to get more lifespan from a shingle system is to reduce roof top tempratures. Ensure the building has proper ventilation that meets or exceeds the minimum FHA standards.</span></p>

    <h3>Standing Seam Metal Roofing Systems</h3>
    <p>Most standing seam roofing systems installed today are painted surfaces, either by siliconized polyester or DuPont Kynar finishes. While metal roofing systems are sold by the hype of long term roofing systems, the main long term issue is eroding paint surface that exposes the metal underneath. Siliconized polyester being the cheaper version, last about 15 years before the metal surface is exposed to the elements. Kynar, while a better paint surface only lasts about 25 years. When comparing overall costs, the standing seam roof is about 2.5 times higher than a composition shingle system, meaning to get your Return On Investment or (ROI), the standing seam roof must last 2.5 times greater than a composition roof, or 37 to 75 years. This mathematical valuation excludes all metal roofing systems except for pure copper roofing systems, of which if installed properly could last the life of the building.</p>

    <h3>Ceramic Tile Roofing Systems</h3>
    <p>While the Chinese and Egyptians figured out some 6000 years ago, ceramic tiles can last a long time. While modern chemistry has made great strides in surface hardness and color variations, the last 200 years of clay and ceramic tile roofing have gone virtually unchanged. Spanish tile roofing systems are still made in lengths of a man’s thigh as when he’s forming it in the open sun to dry, before placing in the kiln to be cured. The colors come from pigments that turn colors from the intense heat, that become fused to the tile surface. Many of the awe inspiring colors from the past, included radiant blues, reds and oranges that required lead (reds & blues), radioactive materials (oranges) that have been outlawed for a good reason.</p>

    <p>Ludowici, one of the nation’s largest tile manufacturer claims that most tile will only last 75 years and then must be discarded for replacement, is more of a profit concept than a fact. We actually hired HAAG Engineering, to test a roofing tile exposed to the elements for over 100 years, yet claimed to be Ludowici by their representative, and found no noticeable degradation other than slight surface discoloration. One can only assume the tile was made of better quality by their competitors or they make an outstanding product that will last the test of time. From ceramics to clay substrates, these hardened tiles are defiantly a sustainable product, yet building foundations must be made to hold they’re extreme weight on building that are firmly planted on bedrock, not gumbo soils of the gulf coast without foundations specifically engineered to withstand the weight. Return on Investment is the best with these systems as they are truly “life of Building” if installed correctly.</p>

    <h3>Concrete Roofing Tile</h3>
    <p>Concrete based roofing tiles were all the rage in the late 80’s, yet a strong tile, after years in the sun become very fragile and almost impossible to walk upon without damaging or chipping the edges. They were designed with painted surface that only lasted about 25 years before the raw concrete was exposed. While many attempts were made to re-paint the surfaces by contractors, walking on the roofs did more damage than good. Not much has changed in chemistry of this type of roofing system and original ownership has changed many times for a variety of reasons. Being said, each new version or owner changed the design just enough to ensure that replacement shingles don’t exist, making the long term sustainability for the building owner unachievable, with Return On Investment minimal.</p>

    <h3>Natural Slate</h3>
    <p>Slate roofing is generally comprised of natural rock slate from various locations around the world. It provides long lasting and great beauty to a structure, and weather’s for that rustic old world charm. System installs require a water shedding underlayment of either water shield or heavy felt papers, depending on geographical location, mostly decided upon snow as the deciding factor. One version made by GAF called TRU Slate, uses a hanging method vs traditional that makes the roofing systems truly sustainable and repairable over time. Being able to simply slide out a broken tile on install a new section, from wind damage or just chasing a leak, this system is far superior to traditional methods that are problematic in maintaining. Return on Investment, is very high with this product as life of building sustainability is guaranteed.</p>

    <h3>Synthetic Composites</h3>
    <p>Many products exist to emulate other types of roofing systems. Stone Coated Steel panels with ceramic granules that look like heavy hand split wood shakes or ceramic tile offer some hail resistance, year long term sustainability doesn’t extend much past the 25 year mark. What we find is that the steel panels may still exist some 25 years later, the epoxy for which holds the granules starts failing from day one, and by 25 years, opens areas of the galvanized substrate is highly visible.

High impact polymers also are becoming a common place, but have very specific uses where ROI is advisable where steep pitch mansards ensure long term sustainability, mostly due to the fact that the direct sun’s rays are limited to 5 to6 hours a day vs 11 to 12 hours a day on low roof pitch applications. Rain water and heat can destroy these polymers at the same rate as composition shingles.</p>
