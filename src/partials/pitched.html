				<h3>Underlayments</h3>
 				<p>Underlayments are used to temporarily protect the plywood roof deck from overnight condensation or rain until the new roof is installed. The underlayment is essentially destroyed by thousands of roofing nails once the roof is installed, however certain materials may offer additional enhancements to the completed roofing system as specified below.</p>
 				<h1>Variations</h1>
 				<p><span class="boldFont">Organic Felt</span> – Comprised of asphalt impregnated paper. Designed to withstand a few days in the exposed sun. #30 felt was used as a overlay material to smooth out the application of composition shingles over a wood cedar shingle. #15 felt is used in most re-roofing applications in today’s market. The only purpose of the felt is a temporary covering until the new shingles are installed. These products will absorb humidity and can cause wrinkling in the final appearance of the completed roof.</p>
 				<p><span class="boldFont">Synthetic Felt</span> – Comprised of a polyester mat with a modified asphalt. These products are moisture resistant, mostly used in northern climates during new construction when the building hasn’t been completed, awaiting a shingle installation and a date down the road. These membranes can last up 6 moths in the exposed elements without degradation. In hurricane prone areas, the application of these underlays can help protect the structure if installed with button capped nails to help hold the underlayments in place in the event the shingles are torn from the structure in high winds.</p>
 				<p><span class="boldFont">Self-Adhering</span> - These materials are actually a version of modified bitumen flat roofing systems with no granular or UV protection. Mostly used in low slope applications or roof pitched with a roof slope of 3:12 roof pitch or less. The concept is a nail penetrating the roof deck will be sealed within this membrane preventing the water from intruding the structure. However, when used in these applications, you must also use stainless steel nails as a low pitch roof will always let water migrate between the shingle overlaps and sit in the areas between the shingles and the underlayment until the suns heat evaporates the water. In beach from applications, the salt spray will build up a layer of salt under the shingles compromising the nail heads within a few years rendering the underlayment irrelevant. For high wind or hurricane areas, the membrane cannot be blown off of the plywood, even if you lose the entire shingle roof, making building damage very minimal. </p>
 				<p>As higher deductibles from insurance companies are becoming more prevalent, smarter choices in building components will save you money in the long run.</p>

				<h3>Composition Shingles</h3>
				<h1>Shingle Materials Design</h1>
 				<p>90% of all shingles come in two design types: 1) Three-Tab Strip Shingle, or 2) Multi-layered or Dimentional Shingle. The balance of shingle types are designer or premium shingle lines with very specific patterns, made to represent a special look. Since all shingles are made from the same basic materials, lifespans are identical throughout the product lines, regardless of manufacturer warranty claims. (See Warrantees below for more information).</p>
 				<img class="left" src="resources/img/sample-three-tab-2.png" alt="3-tab shingle">
 				<img class="clearfix" src="resources/img/multi-layered-shingle.png" alt="multi-layered-shingle">
 				<p>All asphalt-based shingles, regardless of manufacturer, are made from the same materials; asphalt, fiberglass felts and ceramic granules. Heat and water are the two leading factors in determining shingle life, not composition of materials. The general rule of thumb is the greater the roof pitch, the longer the roof will last. This is a science based reality, in that the building will gain heat from the sun, forcing the vital oils in the shingle to float to the shingle surface. Rain then washes these oils away, leaving the carbon behind. As the oil dissipates, the shingles loose flexibility and mass. As the adhesion of the ceramic granules from the surface are demised from the loss of these vital oils, the granules will start to fall off exposing the black asphalt to UV radiation. This in turn eccelerates the degradation and decay of the shingle.</p><p>On average we see shingle roofing systems last between 15 and 20 years in the Texas Gulf Coast and 20 to 25 years in our Ohio markets. Heat is the driving force - roof pitch is secondary to their failures. The faster rain water can run off, the less of the oils are washed away.</p>
 				<p><span class="boldFont">The greatest single enhancement a building owner can do to get more lifespan from a shingle system is to reduce roof top tempratures. Ensure the building has proper ventilation that meets or exceeds the minimum FHA standards.</span></p>
 				<h1>Shingle Warranties</h1>
 				<p>Its hardly a news flash to claim that warranties can be deceptive, and the shingle industry is no exception.  A warranty is almost always described as “Limited”, meaning the warrantable aspects require the building owner to maintain or meet a set of standards that are generally not achievable and the warranty is voided.
 				<p>In cases where the warranty does cover a problem, the manufacturer often has the sole determination at resolving the problem, which may be simply replacement shingles or a certificate for new materials when you re-roof (as long as you choose to use their shingle system again).</p>
 				<p><span class="boldFont">Even more importantly, the warranty does not cover the installation.</span>. The warranty is only for shingles, not the contractor’s application methods, ventilation or geographical location of installation.</p>
				<p> Generally, the warranty protects the manufacturer more than the consumer and should be disregarded when choosing a shingle system. Choose a shingle based on color, design and application. For greater life span and return on investment, choose a contractor that understands the system, the design and can install it properly.</p>

			<div id="" ng-show="contentRight=='ventilation'">
				<h3>Ventilation</h3>
 				<p>A properly designed roofing system must contain a properly designed ventilation system. This is comprised of soffit ventilation and roof top ventilation. FHA (Federal Housing Administration) requires roof ventilation of 300:1 or 300 square foot of attic space to 1 square foot of free vent area, of which should be split 40% at soffits and 60% at ridge. Increases in this are recommended as the FHA recommendations are a minimum standard, not a perfect solution. We recommend a 150:1 ratio for southern climates. Again its science that drives the convection of air movement as an improperly balanced attic will result in less roof life expectancy.</p>
 				<p>If your house has the original roofing system from the builder, remember the home builders use the cheapest source for building the home, with the contractor willing to do the job for the least amount of profit, winning the installation contracts. With this being said, we generally see that the soffit vents are nailed in place, but without the holes cut to allow the air in. By sliding an ice pick into the covered soffit vents, one can test to see if you have cut openings in your soffit.</p>
 				<p>Over the last 30 years, we have noticed that buildings with poorly designed ventilation systems are more likely to blow off in a hurricane as the sealant strips are non-existent or the loss of vital oils in the sealing tabs and on Hail damaged areas, poorly ventilated roofs are completely destroyed as the house next door shows no signs of damage that was over ventilated.</p>
 				<p>While one may enjoy the destruction of a roof getting the insurance companies to buy you a new one, Insurance companies are getting wiser to the roof replacement program when building owners use insurance as a replacement program. Most new polices have a 3-5% deductible for wind or hail damage, wont insure any roof over 10 years in age and will hire experts to determine if improper applications were used during its installation to put the loos onto the installing contractors or builders. Ventilation deficiencies and improper nailing procedures are prevalent in 95% of all shingle applications. If an insurance company can prove these deficiencies, you’ll pay 100% of the roof replacement, get your insurance canceled and then have zero coverage until it’s resolved. This also brings your mortgage bank into the conversation of cancelled insurance coverage.</p>
 				<h1>Ventilation Types</h1>
 				<p><span class="boldFont">Ridge Vent, Gable Vents, Turbine Vents of Static Design</span> – This will include wind turbines, ridge vent, air hawks & gable vents. All of these require the roof to get hot before convection of hot air rising to get the air flowing. We generally see the attic temperature getting to around 140 degrees and maintaining that heat load throughout the day, regardless of free vent area used.</p>
 				<p><span class="boldFont">Powered Vents</span> – These come in two types, solar and grid tied. The concept of these are that they will maintain the attic in a few degrees variance of outside air temperatures, greatly reducing the buildings core heat gain through attic insulation. If your attic is 140 degrees, and the interior temperature desired is 72, you have a heat displacement of 68 degrees. The HVAC system is now running to keep your attic temperature’s down vs conditioning the interior temperatures. By keeping the attic a few degrees above the outside ambient temperature, on a 90 degree day, a 100 degree attic temperature is an acceptable condition.</p>
 				<p>On average a grid tied powered fan has a ¼ HP electric motor that uses 186 watts per hour of operation. Or at $0.10 a kilowatt, in 10 hours of operation per day, it costs about $0.18 per day, per fan unit. Running (2) units for 1 year, cost to the building owner is $134.10. However a solar powered fan, cost upfront almost five times greater than a hard wired, yet in four years, pays for itself as no electrical costs are required.</p>
 				<p>Another consideration is that high end solar fans use motors that have a 25 year warranty, verses a hard wired fans motors that only last 5 years.</p>

				<h3>Edge Details</h3>
 				<p>There are two basic types of drip edge; traditional and double lipped. Traditional style is simply bent to a 90 degree angle and serves the purpose of protecting the fascia board from water draining off the roof edge. “Double Lipped” or DL drip edge was widely used prior to 1980 when shingles were made from cardboard, impregnated with asphalt and granules. As the roofs aged (approximately 12 years) the shingles would get so hard from degrading, that placing a ladder against then would break off the shingles. By having this extra bit of metal protruding, this would help prevent the shingle from breaking off in times of cleaning the roof off. In 1979, the Owens Corning Patent had expired on the fiberglass core shingle and all manufacturers changed to the better design.</p>
 				<p>What we have found is that the best application for installing drip edge is to place a 1” x 2” (nominal) board behind the drip edge, and installing a drip edge a tad longer than the boards face, will prevent all water from coming into contact with the fascia board when raining, greatly extending the life of the paint on the building.</p>

			<div id="" ng-show="contentRight=='valley'">
				<h3>Valley Configurations</h3>
 				<p>The points at which to roof planes meet is called a valley. While 90% of shingle valleys are installed in a half lace configuration, there are advantages of other methods depending on building design.</p>
 				<p><span class="boldFont">Half Laced</span> – One row of shingles installed going over the valley line generally one foot with the other side having the shingle cut at the angle of the valley.</p>
 				<p><span class="boldFont">Full Laced</span> – One shingle installed from each direction, lacing the shingles over each other.</p>
 				<p><span class="boldFont">Metal Underlay</span> – Installation of a roll of 26 Gauge galvanized metal 20” in width running the distance of the valley and then composition shingles installed in the fashions as aforementioned.</p>
 				<p><span class="boldFont">Open Valley</span> – This design allows the metal valley to be exposed, generally in a color, to help leaves wash off the roof in buildings with heavy tree overhang.</p>
 				<p><span class="boldFont">“W” Style Open Valley</span> – The installation of pre bent valley metal designed to conform to the roof decking, acts like a spring loaded flashing preventing buckling from deviations in the foundation movement. By design, forces a complete washout of the valley from all leaves. If your property has overhanging trees, this is your best option.</p>

				<h3>Wall Flashings</h3>
				<p>Flashing is installed to prevent water penetration where the roof intersects a wall.</p>
 				<p><span class="boldFont">Step Flashing</span> - is a metal square in various sizes depending on shingle size placed on top of every installed shingle going up the wall. These are bent at the half way point by putting 50% on the wall face and 50% on top of the shingle face. This is the absolute best way to flash a wall.</p>
 				<p><span class="boldFont">J-Flashing</span> - loved by home builders because of its inexpensive cost, yet requires an installation crew that understands how properly install it so that it doesn’t leak. Failures are consistent with this product and therefore not recommended.</p>

			<div id="" ng-show="contentRight=='fasteners'">
				<h3>Fasteners</h3>
 				<p>In almost all cases 1-1/4” roofing nails are used to attach shingles to the roof deck. Longer nails have virtually no more holding power of a fiberglass shingle than a nail long enough to penetrate the plywood decking. Once the nail has penetrated the roof deck, the ability to tear the shingle off in high wind will never result in pulling the nails with it. The commonly used electroplated galvanized nail is perfect for applications as long as it’s not in a low slope condition as previously discussed, or if in the environment of salt spray being a beach front home. In these conditions, it’s recommended that stainless steel nails be used to prevent corrosion with the salt spray environment.</p>
